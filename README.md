## Inspiration
It's fun to solve riddles and puzzles. I wanted to provide a platform for sharing mysteries and puzzles. A platform where people can share their puzzles and let the other people use their grey cells to figure out the answer.

## What it does
It's a web app that makes it easy and fun to share riddles and mysteries to people. User can make their own mysteries and other people can try to answer them. The User then can verify which answers are right.
It's really fun to see what other's also have answered to the same riddle.
Some of the features are
- Easy to use interface
- User's can share mysteries and show their talent
- Answers are reviewed by the author of mystery.
- Small App size, Installable on any device
- Responsive Layout on any screen size

## How we built it
I built it with django python framework. I used tailwind css for the frontend. Many tools were used such as figma.
## Challenges we ran into
Challenges were to make a full stack web app. I learned how to use django templates and auth. I made the app an PWA (Progressive Web App) so that It can work offline.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
I built a app that improves people's reasoning ability. This is a full stack app ready for production (That's what I think, if I am right). This can make people think and reason about puzzles, riddles and mysteries

## What we learned
I learned how to use django, python, jinja templates, auth, frontend design with tailwind and more.
How to develop with django on replit. 

## What's next for MysteryHub
I'll be adding more features like user can unlock achivements by solving mysteries which will make this app more engaging. Comments system so that user's can present their thought. Leaderboard to show how the user's are scoring. And this app can be a great platform for mystery story writers. This app can engage many user's to read and solve mysteries promoting the talent of mystery story writers.
Adding markdown so that user's can format what they write.
